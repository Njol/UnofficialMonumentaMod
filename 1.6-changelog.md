## Additions
<details>

<details>
<summary>ItemNameSpoofer</summary>

An item's name can be spoofed if they have an uuid.

After the item has a spoofed name set, whenever it's switched to (in hotbar)
or it's tooltip is read, the actual name will be replaced by the spoofed name. (you can see in the item's tooltip if it has been spoofed or not.)

Since the changes are only on rendering it won't stop Optifine CIT texture packs from using item names.

Yeah, that's about it

<summary>Item cooldown display</summary>

### Still [W.I.P](src/main/java/ch/njol/unofficialmonumentamod/misc/managers/CooldownManager.java)

Items with a cooldown (matches "Cooldown: (time in minutes)m") will be shown under cooldown when activated.

currently cannot see whether the item actually has the cooldown triggered.
